# FGSM
# e1, e3
# create a new statistics using L1 and L2 distances, remember to average them. 
# from one layer to another layer.

# Gaussian Noise as well â†‘

# PGD attack

# Concat statistics of pics together from multiple classes
# Chi-Sqaure 
# Original vs Pertubated distribution


# 2D histogram between layer1 x layer4 # Random sample some data from the layer1 to pair with layer4 points. 
# 100, 200 -> 100, 100(randomly sampled from 200) -> cross pairing is also okay
# Match by loss? pertubed - original 
# Match L1 and L2 when doing comparison. Gaussian one is not effective
# match by accuracy? Not on a large scale so acc is not that meaningful

# By diff histogram
